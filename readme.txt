With the AI Assistant, you can interact with Chat GPT from Open AI directly in the post editor and generate images with dall-e-3.

== Description ==

The [AI Assistant](https://zuestmedia.com/ai-assistant/) lets you interact with chat GPT from Open AI directly in the post editor, and images can also be generated via text instructions with dall-e-3.

With the AI Assistant, you can easily create articles or texts, get inspiration for new content or simply chat. The AI Assistant is particularly suitable for solving tasks with existing data from articles (title, content, categories, keywords or user-defined fields). For example for:

* Summaries
* Conclusion
* Product descriptions
* translations
* FAQ lists
* …

With the help of dynamic templates, which you can create and save yourself, work like this can be automated as far as possible and taken over by the AI Assistant.

The AI Assistant plugin can also be used to create AI images. The images are generated by entering text instructions. The latest version of Dall-E from Open AI is used to generate the images.

== How does the AI Assistant work? ==

The AI Assistant is very easy to use. The WordPress plugin adds a new button to the post and page editor (Classic Editor & Gutenberg Editor) to start the AI Assistant.

The Chat or Image view can be selected in the opened window. The area at the top contains the result of the chat conversation or the generated image. In the lower text input area, you can enter your message to Chat-GPT or Dall-E.

By clicking on the Send button, the request is finally sent and the result is displayed at the top. That’s how easy the AI Assistant works.

= Which models are available? =
You can choose from various Open AI models from GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 for the chat function. The models are updated automatically on a regular basis. The models can then be selected and used individually. Only Dall-E-3 is used to generate images.

= Create & manage templates =
The AI Assistant can save templates of instructions that can be reused. Expert tip: Variables can also be used in templates that can automatically generate the title, text content, category or other content dynamically.

= Settings & parameters =
Various parameters can be preset or adjusted in the AI Assistant plugin settings or directly in the input mask. For an explanation of the individual parameters, please consult the API documentation from Open AI: https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference

= API Key =
To obtain an API key, you must [register with Open AI](https://platform.openai.com/login?launch). Here you can find [your API key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key).
